## How to Compile

To compile the LaTeX file and generate the PDF version of the lab notebook, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Install LaTeX
   - Ensure that you have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. Some popular options include:
     - **TeX Live** (cross-platform)
     - **MikTeX** (Windows)
     - **MacTeX** (macOS)

### 2. Compile the LaTeX File
   - Once LaTeX is installed, navigate to the directory containing the `main.tex` file using your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to compile the LaTeX file into a PDF:
     ```bash
     pdflatex main.tex
     ```
   - This will generate a PDF file (`main.pdf`) in the same directory, which contains the formatted lab notebook.
